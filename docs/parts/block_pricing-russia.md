::: danger Money transfers between countries
At the moment, money transfers between various countries and the Russian Federation are blocked. Therefore, payments are **only** accepted in Russian rubles (RUB) from counterparties located in the Russian Federation or having access to payment to Russian bank accounts.

We apologize for such restrictions! We hope that the world will soon become open again.
