# Prepare remote server

**Secretium** is shipped as a [Docker image][docker_secretium_image_url], so this step is mandatory for success.

Therefore, login to your remote server and install [Docker][docker_install_url] with the [Compose][docker_compose_install_url] plugin.

::: tip Pre-configured Docker on your server
Yes, most cloud/hosting providers have a pre-configured version of the image containing **Docker** and **Docker Compose** out of the box. Usually, such an image takes care of setting up the Docker environment and all necessary plugins. Check with your support team.
