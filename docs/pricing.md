# Pricing

In this section, we will analyze the main editions of the **Secretium** project so that you can choose the one that meets your requirements.

## Open Source

This is the core of the **Secretium** project.

The Open Source (or Community) edition of the **Secretium** project is a fully community-driven solution for personal use. You can run it on your own remote server, as an isolated Docker container.

100% free on a permanent basis, under the [Apache 2.0][repo_license_url] license.

### Secretium Cloud

A cloud-based (SaaS) solution of the **Secretium** project for your team or small business.

We cover all accommodation and support costs. This is an ideal solution when there is no resource to deploy the Open Source (or Community) edition of the **Secretium** project on your server.

### Secretium Business

A self-hosted solution of the **Secretium** project for medium and large businesses.

We provide all the necessary documentation and support to deploy the **Secretium** Cloud edition in your closed infrastructure. This is an ideal solution when the requirements of your information security department do not allow you to use the Cloud edition of the **Secretium** project, or you need to control all data and resources in-house.
